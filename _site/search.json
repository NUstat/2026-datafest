You will probably be working with a large dataset so make sure that you have the space for it on your drive.\nWe strongly recommend you create a small data set that you can use to test things on. Then, if it works out, you can apply your procedure to the large dataset. Some procedures can take a long time to run on large data sets, and so it will be comforting to know that your procedure works (because you tested it on a smaller data set) while you wait. We recommend taking a random sample of rows from the original data set, but there might be other approaches you find useful.\nThis is a collaborative event, and team work is required. We recommend creating an interdisciplinary team with a variety of skills. Find friends who are skilled in different software like Python, R, Tableau, AWS, SAS, or any other software package that you feel will be helpful. We encourage interdisciplinary educational backgrounds. For example, a team might consist of students studying Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Business, and Art."

The problem statement is typically broad and open-ended, providing a lot of room for innovation. Your job is to find and communicate insights from the data that help answer the problem statement. You are encouraged to ask questions and receive advice from mentors, while working on the problem.\nASA DataFest is also a great opportunity to gain experience that employers are looking for. Having worked on a data analysis problem at this scale will certainly help make you a good candidate for any position that involves analysis and critical thinking, and it will provide a concrete example to demonstrate your experience during interviews.\nYou will also get the opportunity to interact with data scientists from industry and academia, to get some insights about a data science career.\nFood & drinks will be provided throughout the event to keep you going! We hope that everyone has an enjoyable and enlightening experience!"

He has several years’ experience working in community-based organizations on a variety of issues, including homeless services, support for domestic violence survivors, and violence prevention. Kevin has analyzed and presented data to make it useful to residents, community organizations, researchers, and funders. He has contributed to research that has been published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with policy makers. Kevin holds a Bachelor’s in History from Northwestern University and a Master’s in Public Policy from King’s College London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness analyst, McKinsey & Company\nLila graduated from Northwestern University in 2023 with a major in Sociology, a minor in Data Science, and a certificate in Human-Computer Interaction. At McKinsey, she does most of her work in operations, where she primarily works with large datasets in Excel, often dealing with raw data that requires extensive cleaning, wrangling, and analysis to extract meaningful insights. Her first role after graduation was as a Program Manager at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where where she was involved in business and product operations for cloud computing services. Lila worked with large datasets and self-taught JavaScript to streamline web-based analytics tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-year data science PhD student at University of Chicago\nVictoria Shi is a first-year Data Science Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago. She graduated from Northwestern University in 2024 with a triple major in Industrial Engineering, Data Science, and Statistics, plus a minor in Economics. Victoria decided to pursue a Ph.D. after her sophomore internship at Goldman Sachs, where she worked as a quant strat, constructing a robust data pipeline for a knowledge graph for data-driven investment. Currently, she draws on insights from machine learning, optimization, and inference to develop a unified theoretical framework for risk-aware decision-making—a theme inspired by her undergraduate honors thesis in Statistics with Professor Thomas Severini on stochastic dominance and its implications for portfolio selection under uncertainty. During her undergraduate studies, Victoria managed her jam-packed academic load in just three years while still finding time to climb and chase new adventures. She enjoys playing tennis, rock climbing, and tinkering."
