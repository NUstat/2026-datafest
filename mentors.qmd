## Dr. Raman Khurana
***LLM/ML Researcher & Lecturer, Northwestern University***

*(Judge & Mentor)*

**Dr. Raman Khurana is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Deep Learning and a Lecturer in the MS in Machine Learning & Data Science program at Northwestern University.** With a PhD in Physics and over 15 years of experience working with large-scale data, he brings a unique blend of scientific rigor and AI innovation to his work. At CERN, he contributed to the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of the Higgs boson. His current research focuses on **time series forecasting, automated feature engineering for streaming data, and generative AI.**

Raman builds agentic AI systems using open-source small- and medium-sized models and explores methods to apply them to real-world business problems. Drawing on his physics background, he developed a physics-inspired feature generator that models time series data as a flowing river. He finds joy in exploring numbers and algorithms but finds it even more rewarding to share those experiences with fellow data scientists in industry and the next generation of data professionals in the MS in Machine Learning & Data Science program. For Raman, the true excitement lies not just in solving complex problems, but in making those insights accessible, collaborative, and impactful.

## Kyle Williams
***Software Engineer, Lakeview Investment Group***

Kyle earned his BS in Computer Science with a Minor in Data Science in June 2023, followed by an MS in Computer Science in June 2024. Kyle has always been drawn to Machine Learning and Data Analysis. Being able to understand and communicate about data makes him feel powerful and responsible. While he took a majority of his courseload in the CS Department, it is the **application of math, statistics, and science through code** that is the most interesting to me. 

As a part of his master’s, Kyle completed a **Thesis on LLMs** *(Large Language Models)*, where he augmented the attention mechanism to use Euclidean distance instead of dot-product to improve the performance of small models on OpenBookQA by 14%. Currently, Kyle is **helping build high-speed, real-time dashboards and trading systems to display important statistics and execute orders when certain triggers are reached**. 

Kyle’s **greatest strength as a mentor is his patience**. As a triplet, Kyle had to share everything – even a birthday – and it’s made him a great listener, effective mediator and strong communicator. Kyle **loves talking about code**, and he hopes to be a resource for any student who wants to learn more about what it means to be a Computer Scientist in industry. Outside of tech, Kyle’s also a big fan of wrestling and football—and always happy to connect over either!
