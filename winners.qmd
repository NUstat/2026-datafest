GGAP stood out for their creativity, clarity and polish!â€”earning the top spot on four of five judgesâ€™ lists. Not only did they build a product ready for real-world use, but their explanation of the technical details was both clear and compelling. And just when the judges thought it couldnâ€™t get better, GGAP brought the house down with a clever roleplayâ€”two teammates acted as clients, while the others demoed the product like it was a live pitch. It felt like a real client meeting!


## 2. **Second Place Award - Team NA !!!**{style="color:#4E2A84;"}
*(Noah & Aryaman)*

*Filling in the gaps, one data point at a time*

**Mentor:** Zihan Zhao

The judges were deeply impressed by the analytical rigor demonstrated by NA! Unlike many teams who chose models more instinctively, NA took a methodical approachâ€”testing several models and combining them into a robust ensemble. What further set them apart was their thoughtful integration of highly relevant external data, which significantly enriched their analysis.


## 3. **Third Place Award - Hot Tea !!**{style="color:#4E2A84;"}
*(Ice, Robert, and Owen)*

*Just an ordinary dataset, but with the right model, we can make it trend like a hot tea*

**Mentor:** David Frost
