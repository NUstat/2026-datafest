You will probably be working with a large dataset so make sure that you have the space for it on your drive.\nWe strongly recommend you create a small data set that you can use to test things on. Then, if it works out, you can apply your procedure to the large dataset. Some procedures can take a long time to run on large data sets, and so it will be comforting to know that your procedure works (because you tested it on a smaller data set) while you wait. We recommend taking a random sample of rows from the original data set, but there might be other approaches you find useful.\nThis is a collaborative event, and team work is required. We recommend creating an interdisciplinary team with a variety of skills. Find friends who are skilled in different software like Python, R, Tableau, AWS, SAS, or any other software package that you feel will be helpful. We encourage interdisciplinary educational backgrounds. For example, a team might consist of students studying Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Business, and Art."

The problem statement is typically broad and open-ended, providing a lot of room for innovation. Your job is to find and communicate insights from the data that help answer the problem statement. You are encouraged to ask questions and receive advice from mentors, while working on the problem.\nASA DataFest is also a great opportunity to gain experience that employers are looking for. Having worked on a data analysis problem at this scale will certainly help make you a good candidate for any position that involves analysis and critical thinking, and it will provide a concrete example to demonstrate your experience during interviews.\nYou will also get the opportunity to interact with data scientists from industry and academia, to get some insights about a data science career.\nFood & drinks will be provided throughout the event to keep you going! We hope that everyone has an enjoyable and enlightening experience!"
