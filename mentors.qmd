## [Mary Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-wu-212029227)
***MS student, Statistics and Data Science***

Mary is a first-year Master's student in Statistics & Data Science. She graduated from New York University in 2024 with a joint major in Economics & Mathematics and a minor in Music. Mary has research experience across economics, business, and statistics - most recently **focusing on the impact of AI on corporate decision-making** (particularly in the context of foreign expansion) as well as Bayesian statistics. Mary is **experienced with data manipulation in Python, R, and SQL, and is passionate about turning data into meaningful stories that drive real-life impact**. She especially hopes to support underrepresented students and those new to data analysis, and aims to be a resource for anyone navigating grad school, internships, and research.

## Akash Rathi
***MRI data analyst, Northwestern University***

Akash received his Bachelor's degree in Data Science from Northwestern University in 2023. He has a strong interest in **medical machine learning** - specifically, models that can detect various forms of brain cancer. After his undergraduate studies, he spent one year at the University of California, Los Angeles conducting research to improve gait in patients with Parkinson's Disease. In addition, he **developed neural networks** to detect epilepsy from non-seizure EEG data. He is applying to medical school this summer. His **mentoring style is very hands-on**. He believes developing a strong team dynamic and morale is crucial to any project - especially, those that are time-sensitive. He looks forward to getting to know the teams on a personal level, and maintaining strong communication from the start.

## Dr. Raman Khurana
***LLM/ML Researcher & Lecturer, Northwestern University***

**Dr. Raman Khurana is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Deep Learning and a Lecturer in the MS in Machine Learning & Data Science program at Northwestern University.** With a PhD in Physics and over 15 years of experience working with large-scale data, he brings a unique blend of scientific rigor and AI innovation to his work. At CERN, he contributed to the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of the Higgs boson. His current research focuses on **time series forecasting, automated feature engineering for streaming data, and generative AI.**

Raman builds agentic AI systems using open-source small- and medium-sized models and explores methods to apply them to real-world business problems. Drawing on his physics background, he developed a physics-inspired feature generator that models time series data as a flowing river. He finds joy in exploring numbers and algorithms but finds it even more rewarding to share those experiences with fellow data scientists in industry and the next generation of data professionals in the MS in Machine Learning & Data Science program. For Raman, the true excitement lies not just in solving complex problems, but in making those insights accessible, collaborative, and impactful.
