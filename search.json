Not only did they build a product ready for real-world use, but their explanation of the technical details was both clear and compelling. And just when the judges thought it couldn’t get better, GGAP brought the house down with a clever roleplay—two teammates acted as clients, while the others demoed the product like it was a live pitch. It felt like a real client meeting!\nTechnical aspect: Used \\(k\\)-means clustering to identify leases similar to client requirements and provide recommendations.

What further set them apart was their thoughtful integration of highly relevant external data, which significantly enriched their analysis.\nTechnical aspect: Developed a times series model to forecast the volume of leases using quarterly market characteristics.

You will probably be working with a large dataset so make sure that you have the space for it on your drive.\nWe strongly recommend you create a small data set that you can use to test things on. Then, if it works out, you can apply your procedure to the large dataset. Some procedures can take a long time to run on large data sets, and so it will be comforting to know that your procedure works (because you tested it on a smaller data set) while you wait. We recommend taking a random sample of rows from the original data set, but there might be other approaches you find useful.\nThis is a collaborative event, and team work is required. We recommend creating an interdisciplinary team with a variety of skills. Find friends who are skilled in different software like Python, R, Tableau, AWS, SAS, or any other software package that you feel will be helpful. We encourage interdisciplinary educational backgrounds. For example, a team might consist of students studying Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Business, and Art."

Kyle has always been drawn to Machine Learning and Data Analysis. Being able to understand and communicate about data makes him feel powerful and responsible. While he took a majority of his courseload in the CS Department, it is the application of math, statistics, and science through code that is the most interesting to me.\nAs a part of his master’s, Kyle completed a Thesis on LLMs (Large Language Models), where he augmented the attention mechanism to use Euclidean distance instead of dot-product to improve the performance of small models on OpenBookQA by 14%. Currently, Kyle is helping build high-speed, real-time dashboards and trading systems to display important statistics and execute orders when certain triggers are reached.\nKyle’s greatest strength as a mentor is his patience. As a triplet, Kyle had to share everything – even a birthday – and it’s made him a great listener, effective mediator and strong communicator. Kyle loves talking about code, and he hopes to be a resource for any student who wants to learn more about what it means to be a Computer Scientist in industry. Outside of tech, Kyle’s also a big fan of wrestling and football—and always happy to connect over either!"
