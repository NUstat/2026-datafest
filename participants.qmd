Share a photo of your team along with a one-sentence witty description, and we’ll feature it on this page! It’s a great way to get to know your competition and network during the event. Below is an example of a team photo and description. We’ll read your team description when introducing your team to the judges—so make it fun, witty, and informative (no pressure, though!). You’re welcome to combine individual photos into a single image, but please submit only one picture per team.
