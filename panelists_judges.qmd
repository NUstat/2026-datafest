## Zichen (Victoria) Shi
***First-year data science PhD student at University of Chicago***

[*(Panelist)*]{style="color:#4E2A84;"}

Victoria Shi is a first-year **Data Science Ph.D.** student at the University of Chicago. She graduated from Northwestern University in 2024 with a **triple major** in Industrial Engineering, Data Science, and Statistics, plus a minor in Economics. Victoria decided to pursue a Ph.D. after her sophomore **internship at Goldman Sachs**, where she worked as a quant strat, constructing a robust data pipeline for a knowledge graph for **data-driven investment**. Currently, she draws on insights from **machine learning, optimization,** and **inference** to develop a unified theoretical framework for risk-aware decision-making—a theme inspired by her undergraduate honors thesis in Statistics with Professor Thomas Severini on stochastic dominance and its implications for portfolio selection under uncertainty. During her undergraduate studies, Victoria managed her jam-packed academic load in just three years while still finding time to climb and chase new adventures. She enjoys playing tennis, rock climbing, and tinkering.
