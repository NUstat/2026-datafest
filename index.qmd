Welcome to the official website of the annual **ASA DataFest** at Northwestern University! The event is hosted by the Department of Statistics and Data Science in collaborating with the ASA (American Statistical Association)

DataFest is an **international competition** organized by the American Statistical Association and hosted at universities across the world. Students are provided with a **large dataset** inspired by a **real-world challenge** and attempt to use their skills in data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning to propose a solution within 48 hours (over a weekend).

Students, operating in teams of 2-5, benefit from working alongside graduate students, professors, and industry professionals as expert mentors.

**Sign-up:** Will be open on Oct 8, 2025!

**Participants:** All UG students of **Northwestern University** and **University of Chicago** are invited to participate, while graduate students from both universities are invited to mentor student teams. We are also inviting volunteers from each university to help us organize and run the event.

Students will be provided with a dataset and an open-ended goal on Friday evening. By Sunday afternoon, they will have to develop and present solutions to a panel of judges comprised of faculty and industry professionals. There will be prizes for first, second, and third place, and a people's choice award. Teams will be evaluated on the quality of their recommendations, soundness of analysis, clarity of presentation, data visualization, use of external data, and overall creativity. Graduate students and industry professionals will be mentoring student teams as they develop their solution.

The event also includes a keynote speech from a leading industry expert, and a panel discussion on *Careers in data science* comprising of both faculty and industry professionals.

## Why participate in DataFest?

* ASA DataFest is a great opportunity to **gain experience** that employers are looking for. Having worked on a data analysis problem at this scale will certainly help make student a good candidate for any position that **involves analysis and critical thinking**, and will provide a concrete example to **demonstrate experience during interviews**.

* Students will get the opportunity to **interact with data scientists** from industry and academia, to get some insights about a data science career.

* Students can apply classroom skills to real-world problems, gaining hands-on experience that accelerates their growth as data scientists.

* Students will build connections and be a part of a strong peer data science community

* Lastly, students will enjoy a dynamic, inspiring, and truly unforgettable weekend
