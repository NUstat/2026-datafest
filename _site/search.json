You will probably be working with a large dataset so make sure that you have the space for it on your drive.\nWe strongly recommend you create a small data set that you can use to test things on. Then, if it works out, you can apply your procedure to the large dataset. Some procedures can take a long time to run on large data sets, and so it will be comforting to know that your procedure works (because you tested it on a smaller data set) while you wait. We recommend taking a random sample of rows from the original data set, but there might be other approaches you find useful.\nThis is a collaborative event, and team work is required. We recommend creating an interdisciplinary team with a variety of skills. Find friends who are skilled in different software like Python, R, Tableau, AWS, SAS, or any other software package that you feel will be helpful. We encourage interdisciplinary educational backgrounds. For example, a team might consist of students studying Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Business, and Art."

The problem statement is typically broad and open-ended, providing a lot of room for innovation. Your job is to find and communicate insights from the data that help answer the problem statement. You are encouraged to ask questions and receive advice from mentors, while working on the problem.\nASA DataFest is also a great opportunity to gain experience that employers are looking for. Having worked on a data analysis problem at this scale will certainly help make you a good candidate for any position that involves analysis and critical thinking, and it will provide a concrete example to demonstrate your experience during interviews.\nYou will also get the opportunity to interact with data scientists from industry and academia, to get some insights about a data science career.\nFood & drinks will be provided throughout the event to keep you going! We hope that everyone has an enjoyable and enlightening experience!"

    "text": "Dr. Raman Khurana\nLLM/ML Researcher & Lecturer, Northwestern University\n(Judge & Mentor)\nDr. Raman Khurana is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Deep Learning and a Lecturer in the MS in Machine Learning & Data Science program at Northwestern University. With a PhD in Physics and over 15 years of experience working with large-scale data, he brings a unique blend of scientific rigor and AI innovation to his work. At CERN, he contributed to the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of the Higgs boson. His current research focuses on time series forecasting, automated feature engineering for streaming data, and generative AI.\nRaman builds agentic AI systems using open-source small- and medium-sized models and explores methods to apply them to real-world business problems. Drawing on his physics background, he developed a physics-inspired feature generator that models time series data as a flowing river. He finds joy in exploring numbers and algorithms but finds it even more rewarding to share those experiences with fellow data scientists in industry and the next generation of data professionals in the MS in Machine Learning & Data Science program. For Raman, the true excitement lies not just in solving complex problems, but in making those insights accessible, collaborative, and impactful."

Kyle has always been drawn to Machine Learning and Data Analysis. Being able to understand and communicate about data makes him feel powerful and responsible. While he took a majority of his courseload in the CS Department, it is the application of math, statistics, and science through code that is the most interesting to me.\nAs a part of his master’s, Kyle completed a Thesis on LLMs (Large Language Models), where he augmented the attention mechanism to use Euclidean distance instead of dot-product to improve the performance of small models on OpenBookQA by 14%. Currently, Kyle is helping build high-speed, real-time dashboards and trading systems to display important statistics and execute orders when certain triggers are reached.\nKyle’s greatest strength as a mentor is his patience. As a triplet, Kyle had to share everything – even a birthday – and it’s made him a great listener, effective mediator and strong communicator. Kyle loves talking about code, and he hopes to be a resource for any student who wants to learn more about what it means to be a Computer Scientist in industry. Outside of tech, Kyle’s also a big fan of wrestling and football—and always happy to connect over either!"
