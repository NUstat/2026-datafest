## Akash Rathi
***MRI data analyst, Northwestern University***

Akash received his Bachelor's degree in Data Science from Northwestern University in 2023. He has a strong interest in **medical machine learning** - specifically, models that can detect various forms of brain cancer. After his undergraduate studies, he spent one year at the University of California, Los Angeles conducting research to improve gait in patients with Parkinson's Disease. In addition, he **developed neural networks** to detect epilepsy from non-seizure EEG data. He is applying to medical school this summer. His **mentoring style is very hands-on**. He believes developing a strong team dynamic and morale is crucial to any project - especially, those that are time-sensitive. He looks forward to getting to know the teams on a personal level, and maintaining strong communication from the start.
